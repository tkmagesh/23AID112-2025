### Exercise 5: Travel Itinerary Planner

""" 
Plan travel itineraries. Destinations are a dict {city (str): list of attractions (str)}. Take a city, loop through destinations, use conditionals to select attractions starting with 'M' (e.g., museums), handle errors if city not found, store selected attractions in a set (unique), and return a tuple of (selected_attractions_set, all_cities_list).

    # Conditional for attraction selection
    # Use set for selected attractions
    # Return tuple of (selected_attractions_set, all_cities_list)
